Topic and rationale
PS4 game worldwide sales dataset, make it the dashboard way.

Using the dataset with over 1000 unique PS4 games and their sales record in different regions of the world, we will be building a dashboard with 3 different visualisations to tell the sales story of each game. 
By completing this dashboard, we hope to achieve the following: 
We will have a dropdown menu, once clicked, it will give us a list of all games in the dataset. 
We will be able to choose any game from this menu from the dataset, subsequently, we will have 4 sections of information updated on the site that reflect the sales data of the chosen game accordingly. (We will break down the 4 sections in point 3)
Section 1 is a table which contains 3 pieces of general information about this game (release year, publisher and genre). Section 2 is a bar graph with the sales amount of this game from different regions of the world (NA, EU, JP and the rest of the world). We will have the sales amount displayed on the bar once the cursor touches the bar(mouse on) . Section 3 is a pie chart which reflects the percentage of the sales from each region. Section 4 is a world map indicating the sales amount of each region (a heat map).  

Before building this dashboard, we will perform routine ETL process and load the dataset to a postgresql database.
